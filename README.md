# Next.js 15 Server Component Data Fetching: Unhandled Error Types

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 server components related to unhandled error types during data fetching.  The issue arises when the `try...catch` block within a server component doesn't comprehensively handle all potential error types, causing unexpected behavior, particularly in production.

## Problem

The `pages/api/data.js` file simulates a data fetching API endpoint.  It includes a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors. However, it doesn't anticipate and handle all possible error types, such as network errors or other runtime exceptions.

The `app/page.js` file showcases how this deficiency leads to an incomplete error handling scenario.  While it catches status codes,  unhandled exceptions thrown in `fetchData` can cause a production crash without helpful diagnostics.

## Solution

The solution involves improving the `try...catch` block in `pages/api/data.js` to handle more specific error types or use a more robust error handling strategy.  This enhances error reporting and prevents cryptic failures in production.
